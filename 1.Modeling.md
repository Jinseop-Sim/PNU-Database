# Data Modeling
---
## History of Data Modeling
### Edgar F. Codd
> "A Relational model of data for large shared data banks" - CACM(1970)  
- He proposed a mathematical model to handle data in an algebric way with a set of operators
- It is called __RDM(Relational Data Model)__

### Peter Chen
> "The Entity-Relationship Moddel - Toward a unified view of data"(1976)  
- He used __Table__
- Table can describe everything in real world
- More expressive power than RDM
- Everything by means of __Entity Set__ and __Relationship__

### James Rambaugh
> "Object-Oriented Modeling and Design"(1990)  
- Object-Oriented Language(객체 지향 언어)의 대표적 특징은, Encapsulation(캡슐화)
  - 무슨 내용물인지 알 필요가 없이, 그냥 우리가 사용만 하면 된다.
- Relational Model이 진화를 한 방식이 바로 Object-Oriented Model이다.
- 결국 1999년에 UML로 통합된다.

## What is Class Diagram?
- It is Part of UML Diagram(richest notation of UML)
- Describes
  - Types of objects in system(e.g. 직업, 나이, 이름..)
  - 위의 Objects들 간에 존재하는 다양한 통계적 관계에 대해 묘사한다.
  - Graphical representation of a static view on declarative static elements
- Essential elements of a UML Class Diagram
  - Class
  - Attributes
  - Operations
  - Relationships
    - Associations
    - Generalizations
    - Dependancy
    - Realization
  - Constraint rules and Notes

- Classes?
  - Class : Description of a set of objects having similar, 이름은 명사로 지어질 수 있다.
    - Attributes
    - Operations
    - Relationships and Behavior
  (e.g. Class | Window  
        Attributes | size : Size, visibility : boolean  
        Operations | display(), hide())
 - Associations : Name and Role
  - A semantic relationship between classes : To specify connections among their instances
  - A structual relationship : To specify that objects of one class are connected to objects of second class(e.g. An Employee "work for" a Company)
  - Association has a name
    - To clarify it's meaning
    - The name is represented as a label placed midway along the association line
    - Usually a verb or a verb phrase
  - A role is an end of an association where it connects to a class
